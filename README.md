# Chatterbot-AI


# AI-Powered Discord Chatbot

This is a Python-based AI chatbot that interacts with users on a Discord server in real time. It uses the [ChatterBot](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot) library for conversational AI and [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) to connect with Discord. The project demonstrates how to integrate artificial intelligence with real-world communication tools.
